That's like a pong game code, made for me like the final project of the Alura course.
The game has to ways to play : Single Play and multiPlayer
To chose the way to play you need to go to the function "draw()" where have every project's functions enables to work, e coment usin "//" before the function
that you dont play with, for EXEMPLE:
-To play like a single player : comment the line "movimentoraqueteXXX()" and uncomment the line  "movimentoraquete()" , and do the opposite to play multiplayer.
